## 1. Installation and Setup

# First, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. We'll use Hugging Face's `transformers` library and `torch` for running the model.

!pip install torch transformers accelerate

# Verify the installation
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

print("PyTorch version:", torch.__version__)
print("Transformers version:", transformers.__version__)

# ---

## 2. Loading the Model

# DeepSeek R1 Distilled LLaMA 70B is a large language model. We'll load it using Hugging Face's `transformers` library.

# Define the model name
model_name = "deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm-70b-r1-distilled"

# Load the tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Load the model (use `device_map="auto"` to leverage multiple GPUs if available)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,  # Use FP16 for efficiency
    device_map="auto"
)

print("Model and tokenizer loaded successfully!")

# ---

## 3. Running Inference

# Now that the model is loaded, let's run some inference.

# Define a function to generate text
def generate_text(prompt, max_length=100, temperature=0.7):
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
    outputs = model.generate(
        inputs.input_ids,
        max_length=max_length,
        temperature=temperature,
        do_sample=True,
        top_p=0.9
    )
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Test the function with a prompt
prompt = "Explain the concept of quantum computing in simple terms."
generated_text = generate_text(prompt)
print("Generated Text:\n", generated_text)

# ---

## 4. Showcasing Model Capabilities

# Let's showcase the model's capabilities with a few examples.

### Example 1: Creative Writing
prompt = "Write a short story about a robot discovering emotions."
story = generate_text(prompt, max_length=200)
print("Creative Writing:\n", story)

### Example 2: Code Generation
prompt = "Write a Python function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence."
code = generate_text(prompt, max_length=150)
print("Code Generation:\n", code)

### Example 3: Summarization
text_to_summarize = """
The Industrial Revolution was a period of major industrialization that took place during the late 1700s and early 1800s. 
It began in Great Britain and spread to the rest of the world. This era saw the development of new technologies, 
such as the steam engine, which revolutionized manufacturing and transportation. The Industrial Revolution also led 
to significant social and economic changes, including urbanization and the rise of the working class.
"""
prompt = f"Summarize the following text:\n{text_to_summarize}"
summary = generate_text(prompt, max_length=100)
print("Summarization:\n", summary)

# ---

## 5. Minimum GPU Requirements

# DeepSeek R1 Distilled LLaMA 70B is a large model, so it requires significant GPU resources to run efficiently.

### Minimum Requirements:
- **GPU Memory**: At least 40 GB of VRAM (e.g., NVIDIA A100, RTX 3090, or RTX 4090).
- **Precision**: Use mixed precision (FP16) to reduce memory usage and improve performance.
- **Multi-GPU Setup**: For optimal performance, use multiple GPUs with NVLink or PCIe interconnect.

### Recommended Setup:
- **GPUs**: 2x NVIDIA A100 (40 GB) or 4x NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24 GB each).
- **CPU**: A high-core-count CPU (e.g., AMD EPYC or Intel Xeon) to handle data preprocessing.
- **RAM**: At least 128 GB of system memory.
